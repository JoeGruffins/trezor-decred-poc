# Trezor/Decrediton POC integration

Various tests and functions to help with integration between
[trezor](https://trezor.io) devices and
[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton).

Most of the helper functions are lifted from Decrediton, so hopefully most of
the integration functions will also be moveable back to it.

At various points, this might require custom versions of dcrwallet to run.

This repo is published mostly for the benefit of Decred Stakeholders, so that
they can keep an eye on the work being done towards adding trezor support during
these earlier stages, while full Decrediton integration is still some distance
away.
